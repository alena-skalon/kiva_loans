# Visualising Loans Awarded by Kiva

Kiva is an online lending platform that allows people to lend money via the Internet to low-income entrepreneurs and students in 77 countries.
In this project I was interested in visualising any variations between five countries in the amount of loans awarded by Kiva utilising a subset of data found on Kaggle. I was also interested in determining whether males or females tend to receive larger loans (the dataset did not include data for people who do not identify as male or female).
